# cub3d

The project cub3d is an exercise that tasks students with creating a pseudo-3D graphical representation of a maze using the principles of ray-casting, reminiscent of early first-person shooter games like "Wolfenstein 3D." It serves as both an introduction to the fundamentals of graphic computing and an opportunity for students to apply their knowledge of mathematics, algorithms, and data structures in a practical setting. The cub3d project not only enhances students' programming skills but also their problem-solving abilities and understanding of computer graphics.
